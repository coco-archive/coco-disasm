filestuff.c
    * When loading Listing or Label file, call g_strstrip() rather
      than changing \n to NULL.  This will eliminate \r's, if present,
      also.

dasmedit.c
    * The combo box entry for the Label Class is now stored in a
      global GList *.  A group of default Classes are read into this
      list on first usage, and kept.  Later, we'll add the feature by
      which additional classes can be added.  Perhaps by both manual
      one-by-one entry, and possibly also by being read in from a file.

filestuff.c
    * In function save_warn_OW() added variable fn, to copy filename
      to, and pointed it to string "Untitled" if fnam was NULL.  Used
      it in the dialog.  It didn't bother in Linux, but if fnam was NULL,
      it caused a segfault in Windows (MinGW).

g09dis.c
    * removed def "GtkWidget *window".  It was defined here and also in
      g09dis.h (both globally).  It seems that this should have caused
      some problem, but didn't seem to..

g09dis.c, filestuff.c
    * added feature to notify user upon exit that the files have been
      altered and give opportunity to save (also, this notification if
      about to overwrite them when loading a new file.

g09dis.c
    * changed main window title from "G-Os9Disasm" to "G-O9Disasm"

dasmedit.c
    * introduced dasmedit.c to the sources
      - This file should handle all the editing functions for the command
        and label files.
