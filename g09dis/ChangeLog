g09dis (version 0.3)
  * dasmedit.c - changed the procedure for the Addressing Mode and Boundary
    Definition windows so that they don't lock out access to the main
    window.  Now the user can scroll the Listing Window to find the end of
    ranges, etc.  - Idea provided by Robert Gault
  * g09dis.c - program now looks for file "disrc" in $HOME or falls back to
    current directory if not found there.
  * g09dis.c - changed size definition for main window such that now the user
    can resize it to any size he wants.  Was: couldn't resize below a minimum.

filestuff.c
    * Added functin to "Build to GUI".  with this option set, GUI will
      read output of -g optioned os9disasm directly into the List view
      window
    * Renamed load_tree1() to load_list_tree()

filestuff.c
    * When loading Listing or Label file, call g_strstrip() rather
      than changing \n to NULL.  This will eliminate \r's, if present,
      also.

dasmedit.c
    * The combo box entry for the Label Class is now stored in a
      global GList *.  A group of default Classes are read into this
      list on first usage, and kept.  Later, we'll add the feature by
      which additional classes can be added.  Perhaps by both manual
      one-by-one entry, and possibly also by being read in from a file.

filestuff.c
    * In function save_warn_OW() added variable fn, to copy filename
      to, and pointed it to string "Untitled" if fnam was NULL.  Used
      it in the dialog.  It didn't bother in Linux, but if fnam was NULL,
      it caused a segfault in Windows (MinGW).

g09dis.c
    * removed def "GtkWidget *window".  It was defined here and also in
      g09dis.h (both globally).  It seems that this should have caused
      some problem, but didn't seem to..

g09dis.c, filestuff.c
    * added feature to notify user upon exit that the files have been
      altered and give opportunity to save (also, this notification if
      about to overwrite them when loading a new file.

g09dis.c
    * changed main window title from "G-Os9Disasm" to "G-O9Disasm"

dasmedit.c
    * introduced dasmedit.c to the sources
      - This file should handle all the editing functions for the command
        and label files.
