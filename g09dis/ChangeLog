rev 129
menu.c search.c Makefile.am
  Added menu options to search through the Listing treeview and the Labels
  treeview on certain columns.  This is a pretty simplistic search, perhaps it
  might be improved upon.

amode.c
  Removed a few error messages and error dialogs for when things bounds
  definitions, etc for things like "fcc", "equ", and such.

rev 128
g09dis/g09dis.c g09dis/amode.c g09dis/filestuff.c g09dis/dasmedit.c
  This revision improves the "Addressing Mode" and the "Data Bounds"
  popups.  First, the popups for these are now created only once - on
  the first call to each, and then are hidden, rather than destroyed and
  recreated on each call.
  When an entry is added to the cmdfile buffer, the entry is added on a
  new line.  If the Cursor is at the begin of the line, the entry is added
  before that line. If the Cursor is anywhere else, the entry is added after
  that line.
  The commandfile buffer (a GtkTextBuffer) no longer uses a variable to tell
  if it has been modified, but its own native gtk_text_buffer_get_altered()
  call.  The label file (A GtkTreeview), still uses the variable.
  When the menu entry "Load options..." is envoked, the entries for
  "Disassemble to (GUI|file) are now also enabled, avoiding the need to
  call up the "Options" dialog and pressing "OK".  Also, on loading the
  options file, if a CMDFILE and/or LBLFILE is specified in the options file,
  then the cmdfile and/or lblfile is also loaded into the corresponding window.

g09dis (version 0.4)
  * filestuff.c - Added Load/Save Disassembly Options from/to File. Now
    can save options setup and reload at a later session.
  * amode.c - Added offset addressing capability.  (May need to rethink)
  * g09dis.h - Reordered the LIST_* (listing output choice) where LIST_GTK
    (output to GUI) is first (0) making it the default.  This is probably
    the most-used option.

g09dis (version 0.3)
  * dasmedit.c - changed the procedure for the Addressing Mode and Boundary
    Definition windows so that they don't lock out access to the main
    window.  Now the user can scroll the Listing Window to find the end of
    ranges, etc.  - Idea provided by Robert Gault
  * g09dis.c - program now looks for file "disrc" in $HOME or falls back to
    current directory if not found there.
  * g09dis.c - changed size definition for main window such that now the user
    can resize it to any size he wants.  Was: couldn't resize below a minimum.

filestuff.c
    * Added functin to "Build to GUI".  with this option set, GUI will
      read output of -g optioned os9disasm directly into the List view
      window
    * Renamed load_tree1() to load_list_tree()

filestuff.c
    * When loading Listing or Label file, call g_strstrip() rather
      than changing \n to NULL.  This will eliminate \r's, if present,
      also.

dasmedit.c
    * The combo box entry for the Label Class is now stored in a
      global GList *.  A group of default Classes are read into this
      list on first usage, and kept.  Later, we'll add the feature by
      which additional classes can be added.  Perhaps by both manual
      one-by-one entry, and possibly also by being read in from a file.

filestuff.c
    * In function save_warn_OW() added variable fn, to copy filename
      to, and pointed it to string "Untitled" if fnam was NULL.  Used
      it in the dialog.  It didn't bother in Linux, but if fnam was NULL,
      it caused a segfault in Windows (MinGW).

g09dis.c
    * removed def "GtkWidget *window".  It was defined here and also in
      g09dis.h (both globally).  It seems that this should have caused
      some problem, but didn't seem to..

 -- davebree    Thu, 30 Sep 2004 12:32:02 -0500

menu.c, dasmedit.c
    * Added function(s) to delete a line in the label list
    * Added function(s) to insert a line in the label list

 -- davebree    Wed, 29 Sep 2004 12:23:27 -0500

g09dis.c, filestuff.c
    * added feature to notify user upon exit that the files have been
      altered and give opportunity to save (also, this notification if
      about to overwrite them when loading a new file.

 -- davebree    Tue, 28 Sep 2004 17:15:20 -0500

g09dis.c
    * changed main window title from "G-Os9Disasm" to "G-O9Disasm"

 -- davebree    Tue, 28 Sep 2004 17:12:42 -0500

dasmedit.c
    * introduced dasmedit.c to the sources
      - This file should handle all the editing functions for the command
        and label files.

sorry, no history previous to this...
