To compile these sources, especially g09dis, specific packages must be
present.

If you have the binary for g09dis, you will need several runtime packages
for GTK.  For Linux distributions, these should be available in their
packages.  For Windows several alternatives are available.  There are at
least two install executables available for a MinGW install.  In addition
to these, zip files are available from Tor Lillqvist's page.  These pages
can be accessed by following the links for GTK or Gimp for Windows from
either http://www.gimp.org, or http://www.gimp.org.

These packages, to my understanding, work under MinGW, but not Cygwin.  But
I also understand that there are GTK packages available for Cygwin, also.

To compile g09dis, the corresponding -dev packages must also be installed.
I believe this would apply to Linux as well as Windows.  For Windows, the
install binaries come either as run-time only or a combination of run-time
and development packages.

To compile, either package, untar the package file and cd into the top
directory.  Run ./configure to build your Makefiles.

Both programs can be compiled simultaneously from the top Makefile, or you
can cd into the individual directories and compile either program
individually.  

One package that is required is pkg-config.  This is a program that will
output (to stdout) the CFLAGS and LIBS options needed by certain package.
Again, this package is provided by most Linux distros, and is available for
Windows also.  One source for the Windows version is from Tor Lillqvist's
download page. It is approximately a 35-K download.  It is used for compiling
g09dis, and not for os9disasm, but due to a limitation with the Windows port
of gcc, I could not find a way to implement it in the g09dis Makefile.am
without writing specific commands to link the objects, so I wound up having
to reference it in the top-level, thus adding a requirement for os9disasm
that would not be necesary, in that pkg-config _must_ be present in order
for ./configure to run.  Sorry about that for those who only wish to compile
os9disasm, but, again, it's not a really big download.

BUILDING and INSTALLING DOCUMENTATION
--------

It was decided that documentation building and installing would not be
done automatically, because it might not be desirable for some people.

Therefore, at least for now, the documentation will be controlled by
a manually-created Makefile in the doc directory (os9disasm/doc).
Please read the README in that directory for information on how to
install.
