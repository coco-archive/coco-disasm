PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS
-----------

This package comes in two sections.  Os9disasm is the disassembler itself,
and is all that is really required.  With this, you have a command-line
disassembler.  For those who desire a GUI interface, the g09dis package
is provided.  This is simply a front-end for os9disasm, and is not required,
but can no doubt help bypass the learning curve a bit, as there are several
things with which one must be familiar to get well-formatted disassembly
output.  The default configuration is to compile WITHOUT G09DIS.  To get
G09DIS to build, see below under "CONFIGURE OPTIONS".

To compile these sources, especially g09dis, specific packages must be
present.

If you use the precompiled binary for g09dis, you will need several runtime
packages for GTK.  For Linux distributions, these should be available in their
packages.  For Windows several alternatives are available.  There are at least
two install executables available for a MinGW install.

In addition to these,
zip files are available from Tor Lillqvist's page.  The various packages from
here are installed separately and as needed.  These pages can be accessed
by following the links for GTK or Gimp for Windows from either
http://www.gimp.org, or http://www.gtk.org.

These packages, to my understanding, work under MinGW, but not Cygwin.  But
I also understand that there are GTK packages available for Cygwin, also.

To compile g09dis, the corresponding -dev packages must also be installed.
I believe this would apply to Linux as well as Windows.  For Windows, the
install binaries come either as run-time only or a combination of run-time
and development packages.

To compile, package, untar the package file and cd into the top
directory.  Run ./configure to build your Makefiles.

Both programs can be compiled simultaneously from the top Makefile, or you can
issue the command "make os9disasm" or "make g09dis" (if enabled) from the top
Makefile to make either program separately.  Alternatively, you can cd into the
individual directories and compile either program individually.  

CONFIGURE OPTIONS
--------

Issuing the command ./configure --help shows a brief summary of all options
available to configure.  Most of the options are standard configure options,
however, some extra options specific to this package:

  --with-g09dis[=OPTION]           where OPTION is either "yes" or "no".
          
	  The default is "no"  --with-g09dis by itelf is the same as including
	  the "yes" option.  --with-g09dis=no or the equivalent
	  --without-g09dis would simply be the default.  Note that if
	  --with-g09dis is specified, the package "pkg-config" must be
	  installed for configure to succeed.  This package should be available
	  with most linux distributions and for win32 apps under MinGW/msys, at
	  least, can be downloaded from Tor Lillqvist's download page.  (Go to
	  www.gimp.org or www.gtk.org and follow the links under "... for
	  Windows").

BUILDING and INSTALLING DOCUMENTATION
--------

It was decided that documentation building and installing would not be
done automatically, because it might not be desirable for some people.

Therefore, at least for now, the documentation will be controlled by
a manually-created Makefile in the doc directory (os9disasm/doc).
Please read the README in that directory for information on how to
install.
