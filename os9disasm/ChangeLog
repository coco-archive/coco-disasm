  * cmdfile.c
    + previous patch broke a few amode/boundary things..  fixed them
      (all I hope)..

  * cmdfile.c
    + fixed bug where an open-ended range (such as "02d3-") was not
      interpreted correctly.

os9disasm.c
  * davebree
    + Added function build_path() -  which attemts to resolve
      pathnames.  Resolves ~/ to absolute path ( also if present in DefDir),
    + If a filename is simply a basename, search first in current dir, else
      in Defdir.
    + Rearranged functions [put main() last] such that called functions
      precede calling functions - so that they prototype themselves - and
      redefined many static functions (most in this module) as such.
    + Removed mkpath() {replaced by build_path()}.
    + Replaced malloc() - strcpy() with strdup() in misc. filename storage
      routines.

os9disasm.c
   * davebree
     + Fixed -pd, -pw opts - had left out breaks in switch statements
     + Added a few comments

Apr 30, 2004 - DLB
	Added class "%" - binary mode for a value.

Apr 26, 2004 - DLB
	Fixed bug where register mode didn't print operand bytes

Apr 10, 2004 - DLB
	Included documentation & defs files into archive.

Aug 10, 2003 -DLB
	made coco defs filename references all lowercase, more in
	accordance with linux protocol.

July 29, 2003  - DLB
	Fixed bug where data variables were not correctly addressed

March 18, 2003 - DLB
	1) fixed label class printout.. separated standard named
	   labels from non-named labels, separated Class D data
	   labels from external class D labels
	2) fixed 5-bit offsets to where negative hex values are
	   expressed as positive hex values
	3) fixed bug where psh/pul commands didn't print the postbyte

March 10, 2003 - DLB
	1) Repaired broken -o file (variables were getting wiped out
	   before printing source file..
	2) Dynalbl search path was wrong
	3) Took out a bunch of debugging prompts.

March 5, 2003 - DLB
	Fixed addressing modes:
		1) Addressing mode without an address changes the global
		   default for that mode
		2) Addressing modes for #D and D were reversed.. fixed now.
	/COCO/DEFS switched to lowercase

March 4, 2003 - DLB
	Look for std label files in $HOME/COCO/DEFS

March 2, 2003 - BGP
	Cleaned up a few source files, checked into CVS os9tools - BGP

----------------------  original development ----------------------

03/02/25 10:28- Fixed offset addresing in addressing modes
03/02/24 17:05- More cleanup.. Fixed formatted print header, adjusted
		positions in printout.  Added options pw,pd,u, and added
		current options to usage() printout.
03/02/24 10:20- Another cleanup version.. added -Wall to CFLAGS, got rid of
		all warnings (except for dtable.h warnings about braces)
03/02/23 15:01- Cleanup Version.  Fixed MovASC so that it doesn't run past a
		label.  Fixed MovASC where fcs had gotten broken, and didn't
		add MSB-set char, and changed dtble.h mnemonics to lowercase.
03/02/22 15:11- Fixed Ascii labels so that label name "space" will be entered
		for space character,  added "<" and ">" for pcr mode in order
		to reproduce identical code (for error correction).  This
		would not be necessary to generate workable code, of course.
		Note: this version successfully disassembled the Dynamite
		program using a 102-line cmd file and a 143-line label file,
		such that "os9asm" assembled an identical matching module.
03/02/22 13:24- Label files now can be read.
03/02/22 12:01- Fixed label problem where values 128-255 were sign extended,
		but now class & are not signed, i.e. when we'd like to have
		ldb #-1, we get ldb #$ff.. will fix later.
03/02/22 8:54-  Fixed delimiters for fcc/fcs.  Now stores to tmp string,
		then parses for ", ', #, /, \.  Surely this will take care
		of most cases.
		2) Also fixed bug where PBytSiz not set for B data.
03/02/22 7:53-  Addressing modes work, at least partially, S^ Seems to work,
		/<number> is accepted (I think)
03/02/21 18:25- Offsets work, (*, *-) not tested.  S ^ now works.  Addressing
		modes don't seem to work yet.
		TODO: won't accept  /<number> by itself...
03/02/19 17:58- S,L,W,B data bounds seem to be working now EXCEPT that S ^ 
		doesn't print.
03/02/17 17:38- Ascii data bounds are implemented (except for offset)
