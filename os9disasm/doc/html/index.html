    <span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span>.  It is based heavily upon the documentation for
    <code class="computeroutput">dynamite+</code>, which served as a model for
    this program.
  </p><p>Hopefully it will give some insight into the workings of the program
    and give some tips on how to optimally use the program.  It is hoped that
    all information in this document is correct.

        we need or would like to be able to view the source from which it
        was compiled.  The reason may be  one of several:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The program is not working as it is supposed to (a bug?) 
            - we need to fix it
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The program does not do all it needs to - we need to make
            it better
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>No real reason - we're just curious to see what makes it tick
          </p></li></ul></div><p>Now, having a program we'd like to disassemble, how to go about
        it.  We could take the program, list the binary sequences and pore over
        the code and hand-disassemble the whole thing, but unless it were an
        extremely short program, this could get quite tedious.
      </p><p>But fortunately for us, we do have some very handy tools to make
        take a lot of the tedium out of the process.  They are called
        disassemblers, and they are roughly the opposite of an assembler.
        Where an assembler takes assembly source code and assembles it into
        binary code, the disassembler takes binary code and attempts to
        reproduce the source code that originally generated this code.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm21"></a>Disassembler Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>There is a wide range of capabilities of various disassemblers.
        Some merely produce a code that will reproduce the binary with no
        capability of making the code readable or understandable.  Their only
        goal is to produce source that will reassemble correctly and that is
        all.  This is well and good, but it's often very helpful if the
        disassembler will generate labels that will be meaningful and give some
        insight into what the subroutine or particular label is designed to do.
      </p><p>Other useful features might be the disassembling of opcodes into
        offsets from another area or value, and the additional ability to
        give some value different label names depending upon the context and
        usage.
      </p><p>Of course, these could be calculated or otherwise accomplished by
        hand, after the disassembly is done, but the ability to do these things
        automatically can make things much easier.
      </p><p><span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span> can do all these things.  Admittedly, it
        <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> require some effort on the part of the user
        to get this "neat" output.  The disassembly file must be inspected and
        various characteristics need to be defined, but it results in a very
        readable and meaningful output.  The level of detail is ultimately
        dependent upon the desires and effort of the user.  However, <span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> produce code that will reassemble into
        code exactly identical to that from which it was obtained, with or
        without any specifications as to the format of the code.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><b>Assembler Quirks. </b>Although <code class="filename">Os9Disasm</code>'s code is 
          <span class="emphasis"><em>supposed</em></span> to reassemble correctly ( and it's
          possible that at times, it can boo-boo) there are times when the
          assembler used doesn't produce the same code as the assembler whch
          generated the original code.  If you do get a discrepancy,  look into
          this possibility as well as what OS9Disasm is doing.  One possible
          cause for these discrepancies might be that the original assembler
          generates 8-bit codes where <span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span> is producing 16-bit code or
          vice-versa.
        </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm38"></a>Origin of OS9Disasm</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span> is an attempt to mimic the features of
        <code class="filename">dynamite+</code>, written by Philip Lamardo.
        <code class="filename">Dynamite+</code> was written to run on 6809 and other
        Motorola CPU's, and had the capability of disassembling OS9, Flex, Coco
        Basic, and Motorola format code.  I found the features of this program
        to be quite to my liking, and I'd mulled over the idea of possibly
        writing a cross disassembler of this nature to run on an OSK machine,
        but upon discussing the OS9Tools project with Boisy Pitre, I decided
        to do this project, but concentrate on compiling the code under Linux
        rather than OSK.
        <a href="#ftn.idm44" class="footnote" name="idm44"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
      </p><p>At present, <span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span> does a large portion of what
        <code class="filename">dynamite+</code> is capable of doing.  However,
        as of now, <span class="command"><strong>OS9Disasm</strong></span> disassembles only OS9 (including both complete
        program modules and ROF modules) and RS-DOS code. No command-line
        options for setting Addressing Mode or Bounaries are implemented, and
        neither have some of the disassembly options been implemented.
        Actually, some seem unnecessary given the tools we have to work with.
        However, the program does disassemble valid code, and (hopefully) very
        few bugs remain.

            disassembly work.  This is the command-line interface and it is

            not necessary for the compilation, it can make it easier to get a
            good output without getting as deeply involved with having to learn
            the commands for the disassembler itself.  The interfaces hopefully
            makes the process more intuitive.

            The <span class="command"><strong>G09Dis</strong></span> is the GUI frontend that is to operate in Linux
            (or Windows) running the <span class="command"><strong>GTK</strong></span> graphical interface.  The <span class="command"><strong>WinDis</strong></span>
            package is to run under the Windows native graphical interface.
          </p><p>Remember that by default, the package is built
            <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> including these frontends, and that,
