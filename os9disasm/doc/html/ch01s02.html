    disassemblers.  Some merely reproduce a code that will reproduce the binary
    with no capability of making the code readable or understandable.  Their
    only goal is to produce source that will reassemble correctly and that is
    all.  This is well and good, but it's often very helpful if the
    disassembler will generate labels that will be meaningful and give some
    insight into what the subroutine or particular label is designed to
    do.
   </p><p>Other useful features might
    be the disassembling of opcodes into offsets from another area or value,
    and the additional ability to give some value different label names
    depending upon the context and usage.
   </p><p><tt class="filename">OS9Disasm</tt> can do all these things.  
    Admittedly, it <i class="emphasis">does</i> require some effort on the part of
    the user to get this "neat" output.  The disassembly file must be inspected
    and various characteristics need to be defined, but it results in a very
    readable and meaningful output.  The level of detail is ultimately
    dependent upon the desires and effort of the user.   However,
    <tt class="filename">OS9Disasm</tt> <i class="emphasis">should</i> produce code
    that will reassemble into exactly identical code to that from which it was
    obtained.

     <i class="emphasis">supposed</i> to reassemble correctly ( and it's possible
     that at times, it can boo-boo) there are times when the assembler
     used doesn't produce the same code as the assembler whch generated the
     original code.  If you do get a discrepancy,  look into this possibility
     as well as  what OS9Disasm is doing.
