This is the documentation for os9disasm.  Included is the docbook source
for the documentation, along with a chunked html version of the docs,
using the LDP xsl stylesheets.

You may copy all the files in the html/ directory to some local repository,
or simply use these files in place.  The root, of course, is index.htm.

If you prefer some other format, or prefer html produced with a different
stylesheet, you may use any docbook tools you have and compile them to your
preferrred format.  Any tools that will process xml or xsl language should
work.

This directory is not built by default in order to eliminate the requirement
to have docbook processing installed on the system.  The html documentation
is prebuilt and unless there is a need or desire to have the documentation
in a different format than html, there is no need to rebuild it.

NOTE: It will probably be necessary to manually edit the Makefile in this
directory pointing to the correct stylesheet, as systems differ so greatly
in the layout.  The variable to edit is the "STYLSHEET" variable.
