This is the documentation for os9disasm.  Included is the docbook source
for the documentation, along with a chunked html version of the docs,
using the LDP xsl stylesheets.

You may copy all the files in the html/ directory to some local repository,
or simply use these files in place.  The root, of course, is index.htm.

If you prefer some other format, or prefer html produced with a different
stylesheet, you may use any docbook tools you have and compile them to your
preferrred format.  Any tools that will process xml or xsl language should
work.
