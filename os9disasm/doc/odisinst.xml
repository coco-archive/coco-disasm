 <section><title>Tarfile extraction</title>
  <para>If the package was downloaded as a tarfile, it should have
   the extension of <filename>tar.bz2</filename> or
   <filename>tar.gz</filename>.  For either case, <command>cd</command>
   into the directory in which you will install the directory tree and
   issue the command
  </para>
  <para> for the <filename>tar.bz2</filename> extension </para>
  <screen># tar -xjf &lt;path&gt; /os9disasm.tar.bz2</screen>
  <para>OR,  for the <filename>tar.gz</filename> extension.</para>
  <screen># tar -xzf &lt;path&gt; os9disasm.tar.gz</screen>
  <para>In either case, a directory named
   <filename>os9disasm</filename> will be created in the current location,
   and all files will be created under that directory.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section><title>CVS os9tools download</title>
  <para>If you have the CVS
   download of the <filename>os9tools</filename> hierarchy, you already
   have the necessary files in the <filename>os9disasm</filename> directory
   under <filename>os9tools/</filename>.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section><title>Building &amp; Installing the Package</title>
  <para>After you <command>cd</command> into the
   <filename>os9disasm</filename> directory, issuing the command
   <command>make</command> will build the program &odis;.  
   This will build the program, but won't install it.
  </para>
  <para>To install the program, you can issue the command <command>make
   install</command>.  This can be done either after the program has been
   built, or before.  If it hasn't been built, issuing this command will
   cause it to be built before attempting to do the install.  By default, 
   this will install the &odis; in the directory
   <filename>/usr/local/bin/</filename>.  If you wish to install it 
   elsewhere, then you can either simply copy the program &odis; to
   whatever destination you want after running the command
   <command>make</command>, or you can edit the <filename>Makefile</filename> 
   and change the line<command> INSTALLDIR = /usr/local/bin</command>
   to whatever you wish and then you can issue the command
   <command>make install</command>.
  </para>
  <section><title>Installing the Standard Label Files</title>
   <para>In the top level directory, there is a directory named <filename>
    defs</filename>.  In this directory, you will find several files ending
    in "lbl".  These are the <literal>standard label files</literal>.  Copy
    all these files into <filename>$HOME/coco/defs/</filename>.  This should
    work well for a single user system, or on any system where only one person
    is using this program.
   </para>
   <formalpara><title>TODO</title>
    <para>Include a facility to let this <filename>defs</filename> directory
     be variable!
